# pmbOS
Investigating an Operating System from scratch using c or c++

Primary objective : An app on an RPI stops and starts on occation due to the OS doing background stuff. My simple (ya right) theory is why write an app if I can write an OS which really does not have to do much... 

os3 is the first step, where the app is a simple 32bit os that I can boot using "qemu-system-i386 -cdrom pmbOS.iso".

This is definitely part time stuff, probably more for fun than anything else, but who knows......
